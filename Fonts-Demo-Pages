<p>Like anyone with <span>two eyes</span> and a stomach, I've longed to visit San Sebastián, the city with the most Michelin stars per capita in Europe. But getting there? Let’s just say there’s a reason gastronomes call traveling to the Basque Country a pilgrimage. From Madrid, where I live, San Sebastián is a five-hour drive, but I don’t have a car. Flights can be wildly expensive, and with no high-speed rail connecting the two cities (yet), a mind-numbing eight-hour train or bus ride seemed inevitable. Then I discovered Blablacar.
</p><p>Blablacar, a French company that’s been around since 2006, is a ride-share app that lets you carpool with someone traveling from, say, Madrid to San Sebastián or Mexico City to Oaxaca. It’s in 22 countries spanning four continents, and it’s dead simple to use. The interface works like a standard flight search engine: You key in an origin, destination, and departure date, and the app spits out a list of possible drivers and itineraries. To book, all you need is a credit card and a willingness to share a car with a stranger (or four).
